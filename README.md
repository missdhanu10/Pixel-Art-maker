## Instructions

To get started, open `designs.js` and start building out the app's functionality.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

users should be able to:

1. Dynamically set the size of the table as an _N_ by _M_ grid.
2. Choose a color.
3. Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.
Your primary task is to implement the makeGrid() function, that dynamically creates a grid that the user can interact with.
