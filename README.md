## Instructions

To get started, open `designs.js` and start building out the app's functionality.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

users should be able to:

1. Dynamically set the size of the table as an _N_ by _M_ grid.
2. Choose a color.
3. Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.
Your primary task is to implement the makeGrid() function, that dynamically creates a grid that the user can interact with.

PROJECT SPECIFICATION

CRITERIA                                                    ==>                     MEETS SPECIFICATIONS

* The user can create a canvas of any (reasonable) size.    ==>       Entering whole numbers in the "Height" and "Width" fields, and submitting the form, 
                                                                         causes an empty grid to appear on the page
* The user can color the pixels in the grid.                ==>       Choosing a color from the color selector and clicking on a grid square causes that grid square (and only that square) to change color.                                       Event listeners are properly added to the grid squares (and not to the border or the table itself).
* The user can reset the grid to a blank state.             ==>       If there are already colored squares in the grid, clicking the Submit button clears them out.   
* The script.js JavaScript code works with the 
provided HTML and CSS files.                                ==> The script.js file is properly linked to the HTML file, and loading the HTML file shows the correct                                                                             functionality for the application.Note: You do not need to edit the HTML and CSS files to make your project work 
* Code is neatly formatted and commented.                   ==>  Code is correctly indented, uses descriptive variable names for long-lived variables,has descriptive comments.
* Code runs without errors in the JavaScript console.       ==>  pen the Developer Tools console tab, then create a grid and color some squares in it. You shouldn't see any                                                                      error messages.
